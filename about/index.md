My name is Jarrod Rotolo, and I enjoy programming and pretty much anything there is to do with technology. I love programming because technology is everywhere and with the power of programming you can have a hand in shaping that technology. My love for computers started at a young age. I always like tinkering with the shared family computer and eventually became good at breaking and fixing them. I came to love math and science and figuring problems out, but I have always been a creative and artistic person too. For me programming is the perfect combiniation of the two. Programming is a creative and expressive way to solve problems, and I find it suits me perfectly. Currently, I am finishing out my final year at Louisiana State University in the Computer Science program. My favorite languages to code in are Ruby, Javascript, and Java. I have experience in web development and many modern MVC frameworks, preferably Ruby on Rails.
